## Reflection
This project was my a culmination of learning JavaScript code organization in JavaScript through The Odin Project. I incorporated ES6 Modules, Web Pack, IFFEs, Factory Functions and more. I really felt that through project I was able to understand the fundemental priciples of code organization and gain experience in this facet of web development. Overall, I think I ended up creating a very strong project with effective design and implementaion.
